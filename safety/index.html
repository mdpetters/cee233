<p>The lab is an inherently dangerous environment. While the experiments of the classes are designed to minimize the risk to students, there are hazards, both chemical and physical, present in the teaching labs. It is important to remember that the lab serves other student groups and classes and so there will be other chemicals present in the lab other than being used in 160B class experiments. Students must wear a protective laboratory coat during experimentation. Bring your own lab coat, there will be no available loaners. Because of their lack of protection, shorts and dresses &#40;even when worn with tights&#41; are not allowed in the laboratory. Legs must be covered to the foot. Pants that have holes in them will not be acceptable. To avoid exposure to hazardous materials, open-backed shirts, bare midriff shirts, or shirts which expose areas of the torso are not permitted. Shoes must cover the entire foot and be completely enclosed; perforated shoes, open-toed shoes, open-backed shoes, or high-heeled shoes are not permitted. Students will not be allowed to enter the laboratory if not properly clothed.</p>
<p>All persons in the laboratory shall wear eye protection with impact and splash protection whenever any chemicals or glassware are in use or on the benches anywhere in the laboratory. Splash goggles must be used when working with organic solvents &#40;acetone&#41; or corrosives greater than 1M in concentration. Safety glasses must be worn at all other times. PPE is required at all times in the lab, this includes coming to the lab to speak with the TAs or even at times when experiments are not being conducted. Always remove gloves and thoroughly wash your hands before exiting the laboratory. Students who are asked more than twice &#40;in one lab period&#41; to put their PPE on or follow any other safety procedure will be dismissed from the lab for that period. </p>
<p>Eating, drinking, chewing gum, applying cosmetics are prohibited in the laboratory. Beverage containers, cups, bottled water, and food containers are not permitted in the laboratory. These items must be kept outside or stowed in backpacks. Any food or beverage containers in the lab will be confiscated. </p>
<p>Good housekeeping is essential. Aisles, emergency exits, safety equipment must be unobstructed. Electric scooters, skateboards are not permitted to be stowed in the lab. Coats, bags, and other personal items should be stored in the proper areas in the laboratory room; not on the benchtops or in the aisles. </p>
<p>Clean up chemical spills &#40;including water&#41; immediately. Do not leave spilled chemicals on the benchtop or floor. Chemicals, including water, must be in labeled containers at all times. Keep glassware clean. Sinks should not be filled with dirty glassware; students are required to clean all items used and leave their workspace clean. TAs will check areas for cleanliness before students are dismissed from lab. </p>
<div class="warning"><div class="title"><strong>âš  Caution</strong></div>
<div class="content"><em>Do not dispose of waste chemicals in the sink drains or in the wastebaskets.</em> Containers for waste will be provided and must be used according to instructions from the TAs.</div></div>
<p>Prior to the start of experiments, students will need to complete the following safety training available at <a href="https://ucrlearning.ucr.edu/">https://ucrlearning.ucr.edu/</a>. Do not wait until last minute, the training process takes several days if there are access issues.</p>
<p>*You will not be allowed to enter the laboratory if you have not uploaded certificats for</p>

<li><p>Laboratory Safety Fundamentals</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hazardous Materials &amp; Waste Management</p>
