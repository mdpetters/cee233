# Aerosol Climatology

Covers climatology of atmospheric variation in size distributions, aerosol composition (except carbon), contributors to temporal/spatial variability, thermodynamics of inorganic secondary aerosol formation, and other natural aerosols including sea spray dust, and primary biological aerosol particles.

## Homework
\exercise{
1. Formation of ammonium nitrate aerosol is strongly temperature-dependent. Assume that:
- the sulfate aerosol concentration ($SO_4^{2-}$) is 1 ppb
- the total nitrate (gas-phase $HNO_3$ plus aerosol $NO_3^-$) is 4 ppb
- total ammonia (gas-phase $NH_3$ plus aerosol $NH_4^+$) is 7 ppb
- the temperature is $T = 10^\circ C$. 

Estimate the total concentration of inorganic aerosol using the approximations derived in class.
2. Use thethermodynamic model [AIM](http://www.aim.env.uea.ac.uk/aim/model2/model2b.php) to verify your result. Assume $RH = 10\%$ ("Fixed relative humidity" = 0.1). The model assumed a volume of $1\; m^3$, so you need to convert the ppb values to $mol/m^3$ and convert the output back to ppb. 
- Upload a screenshot of your model inputs and model outputs 
- On paper show the appropriate unit conversions. 
- Compare the model output to your result from 1.
