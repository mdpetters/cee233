The participation score will be based on physical presence and participation during in-class poll questions. The grade will be computed from the automatically generated grade book of the [Poll Everywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/home) platform. 

Exams will mimic the homework assignments and are to be taken in person. They will be administered via GitHub Classroom. A laptop computer with appropriate software installed will be required for taking the exam.

**Definition of Letter Grades**

This Course uses Letter Grading: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, I, W. Grading policies follow [UCR Regulations](https://senate.ucr.edu/regulations/section/513/01)., Letter grades are defined as follows:

**A - Distinction, indicating exceptional achievement.** Mastery of course content at the highest level of attainment that can reasonably be expected of students at a given stage of development.

**B - High pass, indicating more than minimal competence but less than exceptional achievement.** Strong performance demonstrating a high level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.

**C - Pass, indicating competence.** Totally acceptable performance demonstrating an adequate level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.

**D - Marginal pass.** This grade is used to recognize that a student’s performance was marginal but clearly better than that of students who receive an F.

**F - Fail.** This grade is used to indicate that the student has failed the course and will not receive any credit for the course. The F grade indicates that the student’s performance in the required exercises has revealed almost no understanding of the course content.

**I - Incomplete.** This grade is used as a temporary grade. At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an GD grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by the student’s negligence.

**W - Withdrawal.** Used on student’s grade reports and transcripts to indicate all courses for which they have received official approval to drop or from which they have received official approval to withdraw after the deadlines for dropping.

**Mastery Based Grading**

This course will use mastery-based grading. Mastery based grading assigns letter grades "A" to "F" based on a point cutoff evaluated from the assignment rubric. 

\note{
Mastery based grading will never reduce your grade. If you earned an 95/100, you demonstrated mastery. The assignment difficulty is typically at a level that full credit can be achieved.
}

Under some circumstances I *may* allow resubmission of an assignment for you to demonstrate mastery. 

**Absence Policy**

Consistent class attendance is the number one predictor of academic success. Therefore, class attendance is required. Excused absences include
1. Medical Conditions
2. Death in the Immediate Family
3. Military Orders
3. Legal Obligations

Written verification from a from physician, lawyer, judge, or commanding officer needs to be provided for any makeup exam.

**Late Homework**

Late homework will receive no credit. An extension may be granted if the student can document extenuating circumstances related to an extensive period of excused absence between the date that the homework assigned and the homework due date. In addition, *religious observances* or other *unanticipated life events* may interfere with class attendance and homework submission. These *may* qualify for an extension, provided sufficient documentation is presented.

#### Methods of Student Instruction 
- Slides: Slide deck presentation are used to deliver boilerplate content
- Lecture Notes: Handwritten lecture notes are used to deliver key derivations
- Poll Everywhere: In-class polling questions for formative assessments 
- GitHub Classroom: GitHub Classroom is used for homework projects 
- Pluto Notebooks: Pluto notebooks are used as reference text and demonstration of implementation of algorithms in computer language
- Discussion Sessions: Discussion sessions are used for one-on-one instruction 

#### Term Project
You will be asked to select a topic that interests you (e.g. close to your research) and perform a literature review covering 10+ papers in the area. Towards the end of the semester, you will be asked to give a 15 min presentation on the topic, that introduces the question and discuss various approaches to answer it. The vision for this paper is an aerosol related section that may become part of your thesis work. Here are a few example topics:

- The representation of aerosol (mass, or number, or chemistry) in global models
- The role aerosol type X (e.g. dust, black carbon) in process Y (e.g. direct effect, contrail formation, …)- The effect of CCN emissions on cloud albedo
- The role of light absorbing carbon in climate warming
- Sources, activity, and distribution of biological ice nuclei
- Modeling of organic aerosol mass downwind of megacities
- The contribution of new particle formation to CCN concentrations
- The role of biogenic gases (DMS, CH2I2) in aerosol-cloud interactions over the ocean
- Measurement of aerosol chemical composition using mass spectrometry
- Determination of particle shape using aerosol measurement techniques
- The link between aerosol and visibility in national parks in the context of the regional haze rule

You may pick whatever topic you like and are free to expand on the list, but you are required to set an appointment to discuss your proposed topic with one of the instructors beforehand. Evaluation rubrics will be distributed early in the semester to be used during the development and assessment of each component of the project. You will receive direct feedback from instructors on you first draft submission to help guide preparation of your final submission. Student presentations will be peer-evaluated. 

Evaluation will focus on the following aspects
- Selection of relevant and suitable papers (you will be asked to submit the reference list)
- Conciseness of problem statement (first part of the presentation)
- Synthesis of findings from the literature (the point is not to present findings from 10 papers sequentially but to synthesize the results into “understood” and “non-understood” aspects of the question. Synthesis means to be able to discuss the results at a meta-level and it is expected that quantitative synthesis (e.g. combination of data sources in tabular/graphical form, basic statistical analysis should be included)

**Milestones**
- TBD – Identification of title and 3-5 sentence abstract on envisioned scope
- TBD – List of 10+ papers to be considered. 3-5 sentence summary on the content of each paper and why it was selected for the project
- TBD – First draft of term paper due
- TBD – 15 min presentation of term paper
- TBD – Final draft of term paper is due 

#### Readings and Recommended Texts
Reading material is provided in the form of online notebooks. Additional reading may be assigned on an ad-hoc basis.

#### Academic Accommodations
Students are encouraged to take an active role as their own advocates. They are not required to identify themselves as having a disability; however, students are not eligible for accommodations unless they self-identify. Students are responsible for visiting the SDRC office (Student Disability Resource Center, 125 Costo Hall (951) 827-4538, [http://sdrc.ucr.edu/](http://sdrc.ucr.edu/), and obtaining and delivering letters detailing appropriate accommodations to each of their instructors in a timely manner every quarter. 

Instructors are responsible for assisting in providing accommodations; students are required to make requests in an appropriate and timely manner. Ordinarily, required accommodations are described in a letter, which is given to the instructor by the student. Classroom accommodations may involve providing space for a sign language interpreter or real-time captionist, asking students to clear a path for wheelchair users, announcing need for note takers, for example. Some accommodations, such as materials in Braille, large print, or electronic format, readers, and special equipment for testing or composing papers, are provided outside of the classroom by SDRC. UCR [practices for students](https://studentdocs.ucr.edu/dos/uc-riverside_dean-of-studetns_practices-for-students-with-disabilities.pdf) summarized by the Dean.

#### Academic Rights and Responsibilities
All students, faculty, and staff are responsible for understanding and complying with the University’s stated academic requirements.  Students should feel free to express their thoughts and opinions in an academic forum.  Assignments must be completed by the student for whom the work is assigned and without unauthorized aid of any kind.
