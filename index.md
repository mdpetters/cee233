#### Course Materials
Students will need access to a laptop computer with scientific computing software installed. The choice of software is up to the student and may be one of the following: MATLAB, Python, R, or Julia. Students need to be able to run git from the command line and be able to install add-on packages on their device. The computer will be needed to exams

#### Key Learning Outcomes
\outcomes{
*At the end of the term, participants will be able to write computer programs*
1. to manipulate and solve differential equation using symbolic solvers
2. to perform matrix-based regression and inversion problems on data
3. to perform spectral analysis on data sets
4. to solve ordinary differential equations using ODE solvers
5. to perform discrete event system simulations of linear systems and interface those with control systems
6. to solve partial differential equations using numerical methods
}

#### Assessment
Assessment of learning objectives will be through coding assignments and frequent exams. The homework assignments will require students to demonstrate that they are able to write the computer programs to perform the tasks taught in class.  


#### Evaluation of Student Performance

The grade components in the class include:

| Activity      | Weight | Details                                                        |
| --------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Participation | 10%    | Attendance and in-class activities.                            |
| Homework      | 40%    | Each module will have one or more graded homework assignments. |
| Midterm Exams | 20%    | Two midterm exams are scheduled.                               |
| Final Exam    | 30%    | The final exam is cumulative.                                  |

The participation score will be based on physical presence and participation during in-class poll questions. The grade will be computed from the automatically generated grade book of the [Poll Everywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/home) platform. 

Exams will mimic the homework assignments and are to be taken in person. They will be administered via GitHub Classroom. A laptop computer with appropriate software installed will be required for taking the exam.

**Curve Policy:**

I reserve the right to assign grades using a curve, should the class average be lower than expected.

*However, if I were to apply a curve, I would never reduce your grade. If you earned an 95/100 without a curve, you earned at minimum an A.*

In case I apply a curve, I take all of the total scores for the class and make a grade distribution. I then compute the average and standard deviation of the distribution. The mean and standard deviation are adjusted to updated values, thus resulting in a curved grade distribution.  

**Absence Policy**

Consistent class attendance is the number one predictor of academic success. Therefore, class attendance is required. Excused absences include
1. Medical Conditions
2. Death in the Immediate Family
3. Military Orders
3. Legal Obligations

Written verification from a from physician, lawyer, judge, or commanding officer needs to be provided for any makeup exam.

**Late Homework**

Late homework will receive no credit. An extension may be granted if the student can document extenuating circumstances related to an extensive period of excused absence between the date that the homework assigned and the homework due date. In addition, *religious observances* or other *unanticipated life events* may interfere with class attendance and homework submission. These *may* qualify for an extension, provided sufficient documentation is presented.

#### Methods of Student Instruction 
- Slides: Slide deck presentation are used to deliver boilerplate content
- Lecture Notes: Handwritten lecture notes are used to deliver key derivations
- Poll Everywhere: In-class polling questions for formative assessments 
- GitHub Classroom: GitHub Classroom is used for homework projects 
- Pluto Notebooks: Pluto notebooks are used as reference text and demonstration of implementation of algorithms in computer language
- Discussion Sessions: Discussion sessions are used for one-on-one instruction 

#### Readings and Recommended Texts
Reading material is provided in the form of Pluto notebooks. Additional reading may be assigned on an ad-hoc basis.

#### Academic Accommodations
Students are encouraged to take an active role as their own advocates. They are not required to identify themselves as having a disability; however, students are not eligible for accommodations unless they self-identify. Students are responsible for visiting the SDRC office (Student Disability Resource Center, 125 Costo Hall (951) 827-4538, [http://sdrc.ucr.edu/](http://sdrc.ucr.edu/), and obtaining and delivering letters detailing appropriate accommodations to each of their instructors in a timely manner every quarter. 

Instructors are responsible for assisting in providing accommodations; students are required to make requests in an appropriate and timely manner. Ordinarily, required accommodations are described in a letter, which is given to the instructor by the student. Classroom accommodations may involve providing space for a sign language interpreter or real-time captionist, asking students to clear a path for wheelchair users, announcing need for note takers, for example. Some accommodations, such as materials in Braille, large print, or electronic format, readers, and special equipment for testing or composing papers, are provided outside of the classroom by SDRC. UCR [practices for students](https://studentdocs.ucr.edu/dos/uc-riverside_dean-of-studetns_practices-for-students-with-disabilities.pdf) summarized by the Dean.

#### Academic Rights and Responsibilities
All students, faculty, and staff are responsible for understanding and complying with the University’s stated academic requirements.  Students should feel free to express their thoughts and opinions in an academic forum.  Assignments must be completed by the student for whom the work is assigned and without unauthorized aid of any kind.

#### Academic Integrity
At UCR we are committed to upholding and promoting the values of the Tartan Soul: Integrity, Accountability, Excellence, and Respect. As a student in this class, it is your responsibility to act in accordance with these values by completing all assignments in the manner described, and by informing the instructor of suspected acts of academic misconduct by your peers. By doing so, you will not only affirm your own integrity, but also the integrity of the intellectual work of this University, and the degree which it represents. Should you choose to commit academic misconduct in this class, you will be  held accountable according to the policies set forth by the University, and will incur appropriate consequences both in this class and from Student Conduct and Academic Integrity Programs.

4. Obtaining or attempting to obtain, in a dishonest manner, any material relating to a student’s academic work.
5. Working with another or others in completing an assignment, examination, or other academic exercise when the faculty member has required independent and unaided action.
6. Attempting to influence or change an academic evaluation, grade, or record by unfair means.
7. Permitting another individual to substitute for one’s self in an academic evaluation.
8. Marking or submitting an examination or evaluation material in a manner designed to deceive the grading system,
9. Failing to comply with a specific condition of academic integrity which has been clearly announced in a particular course,
10. Submitting, without prior permission of the faculty member, any work by a student which has at any time been submitted in identical or similar form by that student in fulfillment of any other academic requirement at any institution.
11. Submitting of material in whole or part for academic evaluation that has been prepared by another individual(s).
12. Submitting data which have been altered or contrived in such a way as to be deliberately misleading. 
13. Providing false information to the University in any manner to achieve an unfair advantage, enhance one’s record, or complete a requirement.
