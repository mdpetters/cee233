## Homework
\exercise{
1. What is the growth rate of a $2\; \mu m$ droplet of pure water in an environment with 2% supersaturation at $T = 293\; K$? Neglect the Fuchs effect and droplet heating. **Answer:** $17 \mu m/s$.
2. To generate a test aerosol, a suspension of polystyrene spheres in water is aerosolized as 20 $\mu m$ droplets and dried to a relative humidity of 60%. How much residence time is required after mixing to ensure complete drying of the droplets at $T = 293\; K$? **Answer:** $0.98\; s$.
