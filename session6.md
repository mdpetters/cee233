*Problem 1:* A particle having diameter $D$ is located 5 cm above a surface in the
atmosphere (e.g. the ocean). The particle contains -1 charge. Construct a Table that contrasts the following quantities using the units given in row 2:

| D     | (1)  | (2)  | (3)  | (4)  | (5) | (6)  |
|-------|------|------|------|------|-----|------|
|  [μm] | [cm] | [cm] | [cm] | [cm] | [cm | [cm] |
| 0.01  |      |      |      |      |     |      |  
| 0.05  |      |      |      |      |     |      |  
| 0.10  |      |      |      |      |     |      |  
| 0.50  |      |      |      |      |     |      |  
| 1.00  |      |      |      |      |     |      |  
| 10.0  |      |      |      |      |     |      |  


1. Particle mean free path.
2. Distance traveled due to gravitational setting (t=1 hr).
3. Stopping distance assuming the particle is settling with terminal settling velocity ($v_{ts}$).
4. Average distance traveled due to Brownian motion ($t$=1 hr).
5. Distance of a sodium chloride particle traveled due to thermophoresis ($t$=1 hr , $\Delta T = 1\;K\;cm^{−1}$. This corresponds to a strong temperature gradient between a surface leave and the overlying air in the morning resulting from radiative cooling).
6. Distance traveled by a particle carrying -1 charge in the electric field of the Earth ($t=1$ hr). Recall that $v=FE$ and $B=qEB$. The value of the elementary charge is $1.6×10^{−19}$ C. [Note: The electric field strength in the atmosphere near the surface of the earth is about 100 V/m and points downward. One 1 volt/meter [V/m] equals 1 newton/coulomb [N/C]. The E-field is maintained by lightning, which deposit negative charge to the ground.]

You may want to write program routines to compute the quantities, but you may
also compute them using pen and paper. If you use a computer, please supply
the program code.

*Problem 2:* The air is still (no turbulence, no mean velocity). Draw a diagram/sketch of the forces, including directions, that is acting on the particle.
