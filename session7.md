# Heat and Mass Transport

Covers the advection-diffusion equation to describe heat and mass transport phenomena in the spatial domain using analytical and numerical methods. 

\learning{
**By the end of this module you have learned**
- how finite difference discretization can be applied to approximate partial differential equations 
- how to numerically solve the advection-diffusion problems in one or two spatial dimensions 
- how to apply the numerical solver to real-world heat and mass transfer problems
