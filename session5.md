# Acceleration and Curvilinear Motion 

Covers relaxation time, particle acceleration, stopping distance, and Stokes number. Introduces aerosol measurement techniques based on inertial forces, including aerosol impactors and time-of-flight aerosol size spectrometers.

## Homework

\exercise{
Due April 24, 2024: 

1. Define Stokes number, relaxation time, stopping distance.
2. Explain why the impactor size cutoff is characterized vs. the square root of the Stokes number.
3. In words only, outline the derivation of the stopping distance of a particle (Eqs. 5.6-5.19).
4. Explain why particle impactors and time-of-flight aerosol sizing instruments do not work well for particles having D < 500 nm.
