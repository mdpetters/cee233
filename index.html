<h4 id="assessment"><a href="#assessment" class="header-anchor">Assessment</a></h4>
<p>Assessment of learning objectives will be through assignments and exams. </p>
<h4 id="evaluation_of_student_performance"><a href="#evaluation_of_student_performance" class="header-anchor">Evaluation of Student Performance</a></h4>
<p>The grade components in the class include:</p>
<table><tr><th align="right">Activity</th><th align="right">Weight</th><th align="right">Details</th></tr><tr><td align="right">Participation</td><td align="right">10&#37;</td><td align="right">Attendance and in-class activities.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Homework</td><td align="right">50&#37;</td><td align="right">Each module will have one or more graded homework assignments.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Final Exam</td><td align="right">40&#37;</td><td align="right">The final exam is cumulative.</td></tr></table>
<p>The participation score will be based on physical presence and participation during in-class poll questions. The grade will be computed from the automatically generated grade book of the <a href="https://www.polleverywhere.com/home">Poll Everywhere</a> platform. </p>
<p><strong>Definition of Letter Grades</strong></p>
<p>This Course uses Letter Grading: A&#43;, A, A-, B&#43;, B, B-, C&#43;, C, C-, D&#43;, D, D-, F, I, W. Grading policies follow <a href="https://senate.ucr.edu/regulations/section/513/01">UCR Regulations</a>., Letter grades are defined as follows:</p>
<p><strong>A - Distinction, indicating exceptional achievement.</strong> Mastery of course content at the highest level of attainment that can reasonably be expected of students at a given stage of development.</p>
<p><strong>B - High pass, indicating more than minimal competence but less than exceptional achievement.</strong> Strong performance demonstrating a high level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.</p>
<p><strong>C - Pass, indicating competence.</strong> Totally acceptable performance demonstrating an adequate level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.</p>
<p><strong>D - Marginal pass.</strong> This grade is used to recognize that a student’s performance was marginal but clearly better than that of students who receive an F.</p>
<p><strong>F - Fail.</strong> This grade is used to indicate that the student has failed the course and will not receive any credit for the course. The F grade indicates that the student’s performance in the required exercises has revealed almost no understanding of the course content.</p>
<p><strong>I - Incomplete.</strong> This grade is used as a temporary grade. At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an GD grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by the student’s negligence.</p>
<p><strong>W - Withdrawal.</strong> Used on student’s grade reports and transcripts to indicate all courses for which they have received official approval to drop or from which they have received official approval to withdraw after the deadlines for dropping.</p>
<p><strong>Mastery Based Grading</strong></p>
<p>This course will use mastery-based grading. Mastery based grading assigns letter grades &quot;A&quot; to &quot;F&quot; based on a point cutoff evaluated from the assignment rubric. </p>
<div class="note"><div class="title"><strong>✎ Note</strong></div>
<div class="content">Mastery based grading will never reduce your grade. If you earned an 95/100, you demonstrated mastery. The assignment difficulty is typically at a level that full credit can be achieved.</div></div>
<p>Under some circumstances I <em>may</em> allow resubmission of an assignment for you to demonstrate mastery. </p>
<p><strong>Absence Policy</strong></p>
<p>Consistent class attendance is the number one predictor of academic success. Therefore, class attendance is required. Excused absences include</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Medical Conditions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Death in the Immediate Family</p>
</li>
<li><p>Military Orders</p>
</li>
<li><p>Legal Obligations</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Written verification from a from physician, lawyer, judge, or commanding officer needs to be provided for any makeup exam.</p>
<p><strong>Late Homework</strong></p>
<p>Late homework will receive no credit. An extension may be granted if the student can document extenuating circumstances related to an extensive period of excused absence between the date that the homework assigned and the homework due date. In addition, <em>religious observances</em> or other <em>unanticipated life events</em> may interfere with class attendance and homework submission. These <em>may</em> qualify for an extension, provided sufficient documentation is presented.</p>

<h4 id="academic_accommodations"><a href="#academic_accommodations" class="header-anchor">Academic Accommodations</a></h4>
<p>Students are encouraged to take an active role as their own advocates. They are not required to identify themselves as having a disability; however, students are not eligible for accommodations unless they self-identify. Students are responsible for visiting the SDRC office &#40;Student Disability Resource Center, 125 Costo Hall &#40;951&#41; 827-4538, <a href="http://sdrc.ucr.edu/">http://sdrc.ucr.edu/</a>, and obtaining and delivering letters detailing appropriate accommodations to each of their instructors in a timely manner every quarter. </p>
<p>Instructors are responsible for assisting in providing accommodations; students are required to make requests in an appropriate and timely manner. Ordinarily, required accommodations are described in a letter, which is given to the instructor by the student. Classroom accommodations may involve providing space for a sign language interpreter or real-time captionist, asking students to clear a path for wheelchair users, announcing need for note takers, for example. Some accommodations, such as materials in Braille, large print, or electronic format, readers, and special equipment for testing or composing papers, are provided outside of the classroom by SDRC.
