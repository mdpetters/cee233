I then compute the average and standard deviation of the distribution. The mean and standard deviation are adjusted to updated values, thus resulting in a curved grade distribution. </p> <p><strong>Absence Policy</strong></p> <p>Consistent class attendance is the number one predictor of academic success. Therefore, class attendance is required.

An extension may be granted if the student can document extenuating circumstances related to an extensive period of excused absence between the date that the homework assigned and the homework due date. In addition, <em>religious observances</em> or other <em>unanticipated life events</em> may interfere with class attendance and homework submission.

Ordinarily, required accommodations are described in a letter, which is given to the instructor by the student. Classroom accommodations may involve providing space for a sign language interpreter or real-time captionist, asking students to clear a path for wheelchair users, announcing need for note takers, for example. Some accommodations, such as materials in Braille, large print, or electronic format, readers, and special equipment for testing or composing papers, are provided outside of the classroom by SDRC.
