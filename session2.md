# Aerosol Size Distribution
The purpose of this lecture is to introduce the mathematical description of the aerosol size distribution as well as measurement methods thereof.

\learning{
*At the end of this lecture, participants will be able to*
- interpret aerosol size distributions graphed in various domains 
- apply the lognormal aerosol size distribution function to represent aerosol size distributions
- explain the basic principle of operation for mobility-based and optical-based measurements
- categorize the atmospheric size distribution into modes 
- know particle sources and processes associated with each mode
- numerically analyze lognormal size distributions
